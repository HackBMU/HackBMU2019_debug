## Morally High
### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In today's world, we are so busy in our personal & professional life that we tend to forget doing any good deeds. 
This regular distance from goodness is making us fewer humans.

### Solution:
To ignite the spark of goodness and morality in every individual, we have found this solution. 
We feel that if some work is done on a regular basis, it becomes a habit. 
Thus, we have designed this interesting solution to create an opportunity for people and motivate them to do something good on an everyday basis, out of their daily busy life. This application tries to solve social issues by assigning daily tasks that are the root causes of social issues. This will create a very positive impact on the environment.

We have created a mobile application which users can download like any other mobile app. 
This mobile app will maintain user data, provide detailed information on any social cause in which an individual is interested in, give notifications etc. 

The flow will be like this:
- Download Mobile App
- Create a User Profile
- Join any Social Cause Groups pre-defined in the app
- Start receiving notifications

A very interesting feature is that this app will give push notification on daily basis, creating an opportunity for connected people to do a small good work while at home or while going to work or while coming back home from work, for eg. we can create one task like "Don't blow horn while going to work" or "Use public transport for going work today" or "Clear trash from any public place and put in dustbin" etc.

Above daily tasks will start developing a good habit in individuals and slowly it will spread through digitally connected people. There are various other features which will engage people on this app like creating interesting tasks, quizzes about social causes, group activities, chats etc.

Our War Cry is "There is Fun in being Good".
