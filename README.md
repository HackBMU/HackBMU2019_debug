## Morally High
### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In today's era, the working class does not have time to contribute to social activities even having a lot of interest but due to lack of time. 

### Solution:
Morally high is a mobile application which aims to enhance the interest of users towards social problems. This application has a leaderboard which motivates the users to further use this application in a positive manner. 
This application first receives the concerns of the users that will be used to classify the person into groups. In these groups, users can discuss social issues. Users will receive a daily task which can be accepted as a challenge on completion of which the user would get points. These points will add up so as to get a higher rank in the leaderboard.
